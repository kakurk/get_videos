# Get National Archive Videos

This is the offical home of the MemoLab's `get_videos.Rmd` script, which grabs videos matching a search term from the [National Internet Archives](https://archive.org/details/tv).

To download this script, select "Clone or download" (green button, upper righthand corner) --> "Download Zip".

To run the script, you simply need to edit the first code chunk. Specifically, edit the variables `searchterm` and `video_vector`.

The script will download videos to your `~/Downloads` folder.

Report any and all bugs/errors you encounter to my email (kyleakurkela@gmail.com) or message me on slack. Please tell me the `searchterm` you used and the `video_vector`.
